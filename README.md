# Machine Learning project using MATLAB
This repository contains:
- the code used to implement Random Forest and Decision Tree algorithms on MATLAB.
- An analytical poster discussing implementation and analysisng the results.
- The dataset used which was download from UCI repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+failure+clinical+records.

The goal of this project was to compare the performance of Random Forest and Decision Tree algorithms for binary classification on an imbalanced dataset.
It is recommended to read the pdf poster before reading the code.
